# Energy Profiling Plan for Llama Models

## Project Overview

This project aims to profile and analyze the energy consumption patterns of Llama models, with a focus on understanding which parts of the models and inference process consume the most energy. The development will initially target Llama 3.2 (due to its smaller weights) for testing and development, but the framework will be designed to work with Llama 3.3 for more extensive energy usage analysis.

## Objectives

1. Create a fine-grained energy profiling framework for Llama models
2. Identify energy hotspots in model architecture and inference process
3. Compare energy usage across different model sizes and versions
4. Provide visualizations and insights into energy consumption patterns
5. Enable composition of measurements for total energy usage analysis

## Technical Requirements

1. Use only NVIDIA-SMI or NVML libraries for power measurements
2. Support granular measurements at various levels:
   - Model loading and initialization
   - Input processing/tokenization
   - Layer-by-layer forward pass
   - Attention mechanisms
   - Feed-forward networks
   - Output generation/detokenization
3. Create a flexible framework that works with different Llama model versions
4. Implement efficient logging and visualization for energy data

## Technical Approach Details

### Power Measurement Strategy

We'll implement two approaches to power measurement:

1. **Continuous sampling**: Polling GPU power at fixed intervals (e.g., 10-100ms) to capture the overall energy profile
2. **Component-triggered sampling**: Taking measurements before and after specific operations to isolate their energy impact

### Profiling Levels

The framework will support these profiling granularity levels:

1. **Coarse-grained**: Model loading, inference, total energy
2. **Medium-grained**: Per-layer energy consumption
3. **Fine-grained**: Sub-component energy profiling (attention heads, FFNs)

### Challenges and Considerations

1. **Measurement overhead**: Taking measurements introduces some computational overhead that could affect readings
2. **Temporal resolution**: NVML has limitations in sampling frequency
3. **Background power**: Need to account for idle GPU power
4. **Attribution accuracy**: Precisely attributing energy to specific operations is challenging

### Visualization Approaches

1. **Sankey diagrams**: For energy flow through model components
2. **Heatmaps**: For layer-wise energy intensity
3. **Time-series plots**: For temporal energy patterns
4. **Comparative bar charts**: For cross-model or cross-component comparisons

## Feasibility Assessment

The proposed approach to profile energy usage in Llama models is technically feasible, with some limitations:

1. **Hardware-level granularity**: NVML provides board-level power measurements, not per-operation measurements
2. **Sampling rate limitations**: GPU power can fluctuate faster than NVML can sample
3. **Attribution precision**: Energy usage will need to be statistically attributed based on timing and sampling

Despite these limitations, by using a combination of:
- Strategic timing of measurements
- Statistical aggregation across multiple runs
- Differential analysis (measuring with and without specific components)

We can develop a meaningful and insightful energy profile of Llama models that will identify the major energy consumption hotspots and provide valuable insights for optimization.

## Expected Outcomes

1. A reusable framework for energy profiling of Llama models
2. Detailed insights into which model components consume the most energy
3. Comparative analysis of energy efficiency across model sizes
4. Visualizations that clearly communicate energy consumption patterns
5. Recommendations for potential energy optimizations
